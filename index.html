    <h1>Friend Names API</h1>
    <p>This API is hosted for free at https://friend-names.onrender.com</p>
    <pre>
        Edit the URL to https://friend-names.onrender.com/api/
Add query parameters to the URL to get info back about that friend. Ex. https://friend-names.onrender.com/api/ainsley or https://friend-names.onrender.com/api/laurel. Press enter to refresh your browser.
You will see info about that friend in the browser in the form of a JSON object.

*Note: If your query parameter is not the name of one of my friends, you will get back a JSON object that says the info is unknown. 

*Note: This project is hosted on Render for free. Since the hosting is free, it will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more.
    </pre>
    <p>The only thing this app is going to do is server JSON.</p>
    <p>The point of this HTML file is just documentation for the API.</p>
